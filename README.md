# **Sanghamitra Sengupta - Geospatial Insights for a Changing World**

Welcome! üåç I‚Äôm Sanghamitra Sengupta, a geospatial analysis and visualization enthusiast passionate about uncovering patterns and insights hidden within spatial data. This GitHub Page showcases two of my projects. I use cutting-edge tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, Arcpy, Python, and R to address today's environmental and ecological challenges.

Here, you‚Äôll find two of my projects, each reflecting my skills in geospatial analysis.

## **Human Footprint Index (HFI): Mapping Human Impact**

### **The Challenge**
In a rapidly urbanizing world, understanding the human footprint on natural ecosystems is vital for conserving biodiversity. How can we measure this impact spatially across landscapes?

### **The Solution**
The **Human Footprint Index (HFI)** calculates a spatial measure of human impact using open-source geospatial datasets such as population density, built-up areas, cropland, pasture, nighttime lights, and road infrastructure.

### **Highlights**
- **Impact**: Visualize areas most affected by human activity.  
- **Tools Used**: Google Earth Engine, Python, Rasterio.  
- **Methods**: Automates dataset collection, calculates HFI dynamically for user-defined areas(in the US), and produces raster outputs for analysis.

## **Species Richness Estimation: Understanding Biodiversity**

### **The Challenge**
Understanding species richness trends is essential to formulate conservation strategies. How can we estimate species richness across large landscapes?

### **The Solution**
This project estimates species richness (SR) for the Eastern United States using data from the **Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)** program through the bootstrapping method.

### **Highlights**
- **Impact**: Provides insights into biodiversity trends.  
- **Tools Used**: R, ggplot2.  
- **Methods**: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), computes SR at 20*20 grid levels, applies bootstrapping (1000 simulations) for robust estimates, and visualizes findings using **ggplot2**.

## **Why This Matters**

Both these projects demonstrate the use of geospatial data and analysis in addressing global challenges. Whether it is understanding the scale of human impact or uncovering patterns of biodiversity, these projects reflect my skills in using geospatial data to derive meaningful insights. üå±
