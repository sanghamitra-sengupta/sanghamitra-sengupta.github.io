# **Sanghamitra Sengupta - Geospatial Insights for a Changing World**

Welcome! üåç I‚Äôm Sanghamitra Sengupta, a geospatial analysis and visualization enthusiast passionate about uncovering patterns and insights hidden within spatial data. This GitHub Page showcases my journey through impactful projects. I leverage cutting-edge tools like GIS, Arcpy, Python, R, and statistical analysis to address today's environmental and ecological challenges.

Here, you‚Äôll find two of my signature projects, each reflecting my commitment to sustainability and data-driven decision-making.

## **Human Footprint Index (HFI): Mapping Human Impact**

### **The Challenge**
In a rapidly urbanizing world, understanding the human footprint on natural ecosystems is vital for balancing development and conservation. How can we measure this impact consistently across vast landscapes?

### **The Solution**
The **Human Footprint Index (HFI)** calculates a spatially explicit measure of human impact using open-source geospatial datasets. By integrating diverse data sources like population density, built-up areas, cropland, and road infrastructure, this project generates actionable insights into anthropogenic pressure.

### **Highlights**
- **Impact**: Helps policymakers and conservationists visualize areas most affected by human activity.  
- **Tools Used**: Google Earth Engine, Python, Rasterio.  
- **Methods**: Automates dataset collection, calculates HFI dynamically for user-defined areas(in the US), and produces raster outputs for analysis.

## **Species Richness Estimation: Understanding Biodiversity**

### **The Challenge**
Biodiversity is declining, and understanding species richness trends is essential for effective conservation strategies. How can we estimate species richness across large regions with statistical confidence?

### **The Solution**
This project estimates species richness (SR) for the Eastern United States using data from the **Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)** program. Through advanced statistical modeling and bootstrapping methods, it provides robust estimates of SR while revealing biodiversity patterns along latitudinal gradients.

### **Highlights**
- **Impact**: Provides critical insights into biodiversity trends to aid conservation planning.  
- **Tools Used**: R, ggplot2.  
- **Methods**: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), computes SR at fine-grained levels, applies bootstrapping (1000 simulations) for robust estimates, and visualizes findings using **ggplot2**.
