## **Project:1**

### **Work Description**
This project focuses on calculating the **Human Footprint Index (HFI)**, a composite measure of human impact on natural ecosystems. The workflow combines multiple geospatial datasets, such as population density, built-up areas, cropland, and nighttime lights, to produce a raster-based output reflecting human pressure.

### **Project Highlights**
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Rasterio, GIS tools
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic computation of HFI for user-defined areas.
  - Integration of multiple raster datasets to assess anthropogenic pressure.
  - Efficient raster processing with metadata handling
