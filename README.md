## **Project 1: Human Footprint Index (HFI)**

### **Project Overview**
The **Human Footprint Index (HFI)** project is a comprehensive analysis of human impact on natural ecosystems. By integrating multiple geospatial datasets, such as population density, built-up areas, cropland, and nighttime lights, this workflow generates a raster-based visualization of anthropogenic pressure on the environment.

### **Key Highlights**
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Rasterio, GIS tools
- **Core Features**:
  - Dynamic calculation of the Human Footprint Index for user-specified regions.
  - Aggregation of multiple raster datasets to quantify human impact.
  - Streamlined raster processing with metadata handling and efficient compression.
